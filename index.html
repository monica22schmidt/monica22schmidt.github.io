      <p>My passion for technology started when I was in the fourth grade. My elementary school had decided to implement the first one to one laptop program that my class would pilot. As a ten year old, who had not even received her first phone, I never imagined being handed my first MacBook. That year I created my first keynote presentation, my first pages document, and had many more technological first. I had a world of endless possibilities at my finger tips and I wanted to know more. Now you may be wondering when I was first introduced to computer programming? Well, that came much later.

      <p>I was a senior in high school when I wrote my first Hello World program. I was taking A.P. computer science principles which lead to the decision that computer science was the career for me. I was inspired by the sheer creativity involved in every program. I was in awe at the fact that I could literally create something out of nothing. All I had was a blank screen, the ideas in my head, and another endless world of possibilities. You should be sensing a theme here. If someone would have told the senior version of myself that by junior year of college I would have: attended Google's Computer Science Summer Institute and created my first website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, learned Java, C, C++, assembly, and binary in a span of two years, landed my first internship at Alliant Energy where I learned how to automate processes using Ansible and Python, and would now be making a website about myself, I would not have believed them. Yet here we are reading my technological journey on the website I created.
